# curd_assignment

A new Flutter project.

# ðŸ“Œ Architecture

- This project follows the MVVM (Modelâ€“Viewâ€“ViewModel) architecture pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns, better scalability, and easier testing.

- Model â†’ Represents the data layer (API responses, local storage models, entities).

- View â†’ The UI layer responsible for rendering data and capturing user interactions.

- ViewModel (Bloc/Cubit) â†’ Handles the business logic and state of the application, acting as the bridge between the View and Model.

The MVVM + Bloc Cubit approach was chosen because:

- It provides a clear flow of data and reactive UI updates.

- Business logic is kept separate from the UI, making the app easier to maintain.

- Bloc Cubit allows streamlined state management with less boilerplate than traditional Bloc, but still follows predictable state flow.

- Built-in support for BlocConsumer, BlocBuilder, and BlocListener makes it easy to listen to and react to state changes.

| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **flutter\_bloc**            | State management     | Provides a predictable and testable state management solution. Cubit was chosen for its simplicity and minimal boilerplate. |
| **cached\_network\_image**   | Image caching        | Improves performance by caching images locally and reducing network calls.                                                  |
| **flutter\_secure\_storage** | Secure local storage | Stores sensitive data (cart items, preferences) securely on the device.                                                     |
| **go\_router**               | Navigation           | Provides declarative, URL-based navigation with support for deep linking.                                                   |
| **fluttertoast**             | Toast messages       | Displays short, non-intrusive feedback to the user.                                                                         |
